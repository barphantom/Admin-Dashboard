# Admin Dashboard
This project is my first ever admin dashboard interface built with HTML and CSS, designed for managing user information, projects, and announcements. The dashboard features a sidebar navigation menu, a top bar with search bar and user profile access, and main content sections that display project details, trending items, and recent announcements.
